#Interprete the clusters with respect to numerical variables (b)
```{r}
#Cluster 1 represents companies having positive Market_Cap, ROE, ROA, Asset_Turnover and NetProfitMargin,  with negative Beta, PE-Ratio, Leverage and Revenue Growth, while Cluster 2 represents the reverse.

#Ten and eleven companies are in Cluster 1 and 2 respectively

#The within cluster sum of square errors are 43.30886 and 75.26049 respectively for cluster 1 and 2. This suggests that the distribution in Cluster 1 is more compact than in Cluster 2.

#The overall sum of square errors is 34.1 % which is relatively low and suggests an overall compact distribution.
```

#Pattern in the cluster (c)

```{r}
Pattern <- Pharm %>% select(c(12,13,14)) %>% mutate(Cluster = k2$cluster)
print(Pattern)
Median_Recommendation <- ggplot(Pattern, mapping = aes(factor(Cluster), fill=Median_Recommendation)) + geom_bar(position = 'dodge') + labs(x='Clusters', y='Frequence')
Median_Recommendation
#There appears to be a pattern consisting of brokerages recommending a strong buy for companies in Cluster 2 and not for companies in Cluster 1. Brokerages are also tend recommend a "hold" for companies in Cluster 1 more than Cluster 2.
```

#Provide appropriate names for each cluster (d)
```{r}
#Cluster1 could be named LOW RISK/HIGH RETURN because although they have on average negative revenue growth, they show on average a positive market capitalization, ROE, ROA, Asset Turnover and Net Profit. They also have negative leverage, negative Beta and PE_Ratio
#Cluster2 on the contrary is HIGH RISK/LOW RETURN because companies in this cluster portray opposite characteristics to cluster 1 companies. That is, higher Beta and PE ratio on average as well as higher leverage while running negative net profit margins, market capitalization, asset turnover etc.
