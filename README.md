# Kmeans-Classification-of-Pharmaceutical-Companies


Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to use k-Means for clustering.
Directions
An equities analyst is studying the pharmaceutical industry and would like your help in exploring and understanding
the financial data collected by her firm. Her main objective is to understand the structure of the pharmaceutical
industry using some basic financial measures. Financial data gathered on 21 firms in the pharmaceutical industry are
available in the file Pharmaceuticals.csv.

For each firm, the following variables are recorded:
  1. Market capitalization (in billions of dollars)
  2. Beta
  3. Price/earnings ratio
  4. Return on equity
  5. Return on assets
  6. Asset turnover
  7. Leverage
  8. Estimated revenue growth
  9. Net profit margin
  10. Median recommendation (across major brokerages)
  11. Location of firmâ€™s headquarters
  12. Stock exchange on which the firm is listed

Use cluster analysis to explore and analyze the given dataset as follows:
a. Use only the numerical variables (1 to 9) to cluster the 21 firms. Justify the various choices made in
conducting the cluster analysis, such as weights for different variables, the specific clustering algorithm(s)
used, the number of clusters formed, and so on.
b. Interpret the clusters with respect to the numerical variables used in forming the clusters.
c. Is there a pattern in the clusters with respect to the numerical variables (10 to 12)? (those not used in
forming the clusters)
d. Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset.
